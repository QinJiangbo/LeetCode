 * @description:
        Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length
        of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

        For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has
        length = 2.

        Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring
        is "()()", which has length = 4.
